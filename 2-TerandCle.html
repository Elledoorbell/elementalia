    <h1> What is Water? </h1>
	<h3> Water, a substance composed of the chemical elements hydrogen and oxygen and existing in gaseous, liquid, and solid states. It is one of the most plentiful and essential of compounds. A tasteless and odorless liquid at room temperature, it has the important ability to dissolve many other substances. Indeed, the versatility of water as a solvent is essential to living organisms. Life is believed to have originated in the aqueous solutions of the world’s oceans, and living organisms depend on aqueous solutions, such as blood and digestive juices, for biological processes. Water also exists on other planets and moons both within and beyond the solar system. In small quantities water appears colorless, but water actually has an intrinsic blue color caused by slight absorption of light at red wavelengths. </h3

    <div class="row">
	    <div class="course-col">
		<h2> Solid</h2>
		<p> When water is in its solid-state (ice), the water molecules are packed close together preventing it from changing shape. Ice has a very regular pattern with the molecules rigidly apart from one another connected by the hydrogen bonds that form a crystalline lattice. These crystals have a number of open regions and pockets making ice less dense than liquid water. This is why ice floats on water. Ice forms when the temperature is below freezing (0° Celsius or 32° Fahrenheit). </p>
	    </div>
		 <div class="course-col">
		<h2> Liquid </h2>
		<p> In liquid water, hydrogen bonds are constantly formed and broken as the water molecules slide past each other. The breaking of these bonds is caused by the motion (kinetic energy) of the water molecules due to the heat contained in the system.
When ice is warmed above freezing, it melts and becomes liquid water. As a liquid, the attractive forces between molecules weaken and individual molecules can begin to move around each other. Because the molecules can slip and slide around one another, water takes the shape of any container it is in. </p>
	    </div>
		 <div class="course-col">
		<h2> Gas </h2>
		<p> The third state of water is the gaseous state (water vapor). In this state, water molecules move very rapidly and are not bound together. Although we cannot see water in its gaseous state, we can feel it in the air on a hot, humid day. Commonly, water boils at a temperature of 100° C (212° F), forming water vapor. </p>

		<h3> Precipitation </h3>
		</div>
	    <div class="testimonials-col">
		<h2> Precipitation </h2>
		<p> Precipitation is any liquid or frozen water that forms in the atmosphere and falls back to the earth. It comes in many forms, like rain, sleet, and snow.  </p>
		</div>
	    <div class="testimonials-col">
		<h2>  </h2>
		<p> Along with evaporation and condensation, precipitation is one of the three major parts of the global water cycle. <b>Precipitation can either be solid or liquid depending on what form it falls down on earth.</b> </p>

		</div>
	    <div class="testimonials-col">
		<h2> Precipitation </h2>
		<p> Precipitation forms in the clouds when water vapor condenses into bigger and bigger droplets of water. When the drops are heavy enough, they fall to the earth. If a cloud is colder, like it would be at higher altitudes, the water droplets may freeze to form ice.  </p>
		</div>
	    <div class="testimonials-col">
		<h2> Precipitation-2</h2>
		<p> These ice crystals then fall to the earth as snow, hail, or rain, depending on the temperature within the cloud and at Earth’s surface. Most rain actually begins as snow high in the clouds. As the snowflakes fall through warmer air, they become raindrops. </p>

	<div class="row">
	    <div class="testimonials-col">
		<h2> Condensation </h2>
		<p> Condensation is when a gas turns to a liquid. It has been defined to include those reactions in which two molecules are joined with loss of water. It is the removal of heat from a system in such a manner that vapor is converted into liquid. </p>
		</div>
	    <div class="testimonials-col">
		<h2> Collection </h2>
		<p>  Collection is the stage of the water cycle where water is temporarily collected and stored. As water returns to the Earth’s surface, it will run-off into our rivers, streams, lakes, and glaciers.  </p>
		</div>
	    <div class="testimonials-col">
		<h2> Collection-2</h2>
		<p> However, most precipitation will collect in one of the Earth’s oceans, where 97% of all water sources are currently deposited. During the collection phase, water will also infiltrate into the ground and fill our alluvial and deep formation aquifers.

		<h3> Evaporation </h3>
		</div>
	    <div class="testimonials-col">
		<h2> Evaporation </h2>
		<p> Evaporation happens when a liquid turn into a gas. It can be easily visualized when rain puddles “disappear” on a hot day or when wet clothes dry in the sun. </p>
		</div>
	    <div class="testimonials-col">
		<h2> Evaporation-2</h2>
		<p>  In these examples, the liquid water is not actually vanishing—it is evaporating into a gas, called water vapor. </p>
