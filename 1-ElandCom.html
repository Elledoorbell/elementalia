Iron is an important mineral that your body needs to make hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. Red blood cells help carry oxygen throughout your body. </p>
		</div>
	    <div class="testimonials-col">
		<h3> Calcium </h3>
		<p>Calcium is a metallic chemical element of the alkaline-earth group that occurs naturally only in combination and is essential to cellular functions in all known organisms. It is the mineral you have the most of in your body. It makes up the structures of your bones and teeth and also helps maintain typical muscle function, blood clotting, nerve transmission, and other body processes.
           About 99% of your body’s calcium is stored in your bones. Your bones act as a calcium reservoir that your body draws from to maintain balance. </p>

    <div class="row">
	    <div class="course-col">
		<h2> Compounds </h2>
		<p> A compound is a substance made up of two or more different chemical elements. When the elements come together, they react with each other and form chemical bonds that are difficult to break. These bonds form as a result of sharing or exchanging electrons between atoms. </p>
	    </div>
		 <div class="course-col">
		<h2>  </h2>
		<p> Compounds also have distinct properties, such as solubility, boiling point, reactivity and melting point. Compounds occur when two or more atoms combine into a pure substance. Compounds are important since they contain carbon in all organisms. Compounds are also found in the wood we eat, the air, and even our clothes. Everything in the world is made up of compounds. </p>
